# Deep Learning Studies using the PyTorch Library

These notebooks contain concepts related to:

    - PyTorch syntax
    - perceptrons
    - neural networks
    - linear layers
    - linear classifications
    - linear models
    - activation functions
    - model architecture with PyTorch
    - loss functions
    - optimization
    - Segmentation
    - Convolution 1D
    - Convolution 2D

and the application of these concepts in classification and regression models. Thus, these notebooks serve to document my studies and learnings related to PyTorch syntax and Deep Learning concepts, which have been applied in the projects within this repository.
