# Deep Learning Studies using the Tensorflow Library

These notebooks contain concepts related to:

- Tensorflow syntax
- perceptrons
- neural networks
- linear layers
- linear classifications
- linear models
- activation functions
- model architecture with Tensorflow
- loss functions
- optimization
- Segmentation
- LSTM architecture
- Convolution 1D
- Convolution 2D

and the application of these concepts in classification and regression models. Thus, these notebooks serve to document my studies and learnings related to Tensorflow syntax and Deep Learning concepts, which have been applied in the projects within this repository.
