# Project README

## Overview

This project is an educational journey through sentiment analysis using the 'nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment' BERT-based model. Here's a breakdown of the key learnings:

- **Dependency Installation:** Learn to set up essential dependencies such as PyTorch, torchvision, torchaudio, transformers, requests, beautifulsoup4, pandas, and numpy.

- **Model Loading:** Understand the process of loading pre-trained models, specifically a BERT tokenizer and a sequence classification model for sentiment analysis using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

- **Text Encoding and Sentiment Analysis:** Explore how to encode textual data using the loaded tokenizer and calculate sentiment scores with the BERT-based sentiment analysis model.

- **Web Scraping for Reviews:** Gain practical experience in web scraping by extracting Yelp reviews from a specified URL using BeautifulSoup.

- **Data Handling with Pandas:** Learn to work with data in a structured manner using Pandas DataFrames, enabling efficient storage, manipulation, and analysis of scraped reviews.

- **Real-World Application:** Apply sentiment analysis techniques to real Yelp reviews, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.

By engaging with this project, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of sentiment analysis workflows, model loading procedures, web scraping techniques, and data manipulation skills.
