# Image Classification using PyTorch

This Python project utilizes the PyTorch library to train an image classification model using a simple neural network architecture. The goal is to classify hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Operation

- Data Loading: Utilizes the MNIST dataset for model training.
- Model Definition: Defines a simple neural network architecture for image classification.
- Training: Uses the Adam optimizer and CrossEntropy loss function to train the model.
- Saving/Loading the Model: Saves the trained model's state to a file and reloads it when needed.
- Inference on a New Image: Loads a new image, converts it into a tensor, and performs inference with the trained model.

This project serves as a basic example of image classification using Multi Layer Perceptron with PyTorch and can be extended to tackle more complex problems.
